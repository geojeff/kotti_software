        kotti_software
        ==============
        
        This is an extension to the Kotti CMS that adds a system for presenting
        software projects on your site.
        
        kotti_software started as a copy of kotti_blog.

        Setting up kotti_software
        =========================
        
        This Addon adds two new Content Types to your Kotti site.
        To set up the content types add ``kotti_software.kotti_configure``
        to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your ini file::
        
            kotti.configurators = kotti_software.kotti_configure
        
        Now you can create a software collection and add software projects.
        
        There are different settings to adjust the behavior of the
        software.
        
        You can select if the software projects in the collection overview
        should be batched. If you set 
        ``kotti_software.collection_settings.use_batching`` to ``true``
        (the default value) the software projects will be shown on separate
        pages. If you set it to ``false`` all software projects are shown
        all together on one page::
        
            kotti_software.collection_settings.use_batching = false
        
        If you use batching you can choose how many software projects are
        shown on one page. The default value for 
        ``kotti_software.collection_settings.pagesize`` is 5::
        
            kotti_software.collection_settings.pagesize = 10
        
        You can use auto batching where the next page of the software projects
        is automatically loaded when scrolling down the overview page instead
        of showing links to switch the pages. The default for
        ``kotti_software.collection_settings.use_auto_batching`` is ``true``::
        
            kotti_software.collection_settings.use_auto_batching = false
        
        With ``kotti_software.collection_settings.link_headline_overview`` you
        can control whether the headline of a software project in the
        collection overview is linked to the software project or not. This
        setting defaults to ``true``::
        
            kotti_software.collection_settings.link_headline_overview = false
        
        Parts of kotti_software can be overridden with the setting
        ``kotti_software.asset_overrides``. Have a look to the 
        `Kotti documentation about the asset_overrides setting`_, which is the
        same as in ``kotti_software``.
        
        Be warned: This addon is in alpha state. Use it at your own risk.
        
        Using kotti_software
        ====================
        
        Add a software collection to your site, then to that add software projects.
        For software projects, you can provide a date, which you will need to
        manually keep up to date. Or, you can provide a json_url instead of a date
        and the last-updated date for the project, along with main urls and a few
        data items, will be gathered from a JSON source. 

        Here are ways to enter software projects:
        
            1) Enter the JSON url only (for JSON-fetched date and data)
        
            2) Enter the date and any of: home_page, docs_url,
               package_url, bugtrack_url (manual entry)
        
            3) Enter the date only (bare-bones entry, with just date and
               title, and whatever is in body -- useful for defunct
               projects)

        There is a date-handling select list to set, accordingly, for 1), 2), or 3).
       
        In a manner similar to date handling, you can enter a description, or you may
        set the description from either the summary or description in the JSON data.
 
        For the JSON data, if your project is a Python project and it has been posted
        to pypi.python.org, you can enter the JSON url for that, as described below.
        Otherwise, make your own JSON file, using the following format, and post it
        somewhere, then enter that URL.
        
        ::
        
            {
                "info": {
                    "home_page": "http://kotti.pylonsproject.org",
                    "docs_url": "http://packages.python.org/Kotti", 
                    "package_url": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Kotti", 
                    "bugtrack_url": "", 
                    "description": "Kotti is a high-level, 'Pythonic' framework...",
                    "summary": "Kotti is a high-level, 'Pythonic' framework..."
                }, 
                "urls": [ { "upload_time": "2012-08-30T11:59:58", } ]
            }
        
        Note that the home_page, docs_url, package_url, and bugtrack_url are key/value
        pairs in "info", but the date is derived from "upload_time" in "urls". If the
        data structure for upload_time looks unnecessarily complicated, it is this
        way because we follow the pypi JSON structure. kotti_software is written, in
        part, for use on the Kotti website, and thus presents Python projects that
        are posted on pypi. Also, kotti_software is used by Kotti developers on their
        personal websites, and they tend to have Python projects. However, any type of
        project can be posted, for javascript, Ruby, etc. Just follow the data structure
        format above for creating a custom JSON data structure for each project.
        
        If you need to customize kotti_software itself, the urls are accessed as
        json_obj['info']['docs_url'], and the upload_time is accessed as
        json_obj['urls'][0]['upload_time'].
        
        If the description is entered manually, it is used, but if left blank, and the
        "summary" item in the JSON data is not empty, the summary is used as the
        description.
        
        **Instructions for JSON sources:**
        
        pypi
        ----
        
        Enter the url of the form "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/{project name}/json",
        where {project name} is the case-sensitive name of the project on pypi. For
        example, for Kotti the url is "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Kotti/json".
        
        See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Kotti/json to see the JSON that is parsed.
        
        Hosting Elsewhere
        -----------------
        
        As an alternative to pypi, if your project is not posted there, you may put
        a JSON file somewhere in your github, bitbucket, or other repo, and access
        it with the raw url, such as this example for github:
        
        json_url = "https://raw.github.com/geojeff/kotti_fruits_example/master/json"
        
        As described above, you will need to follow the format of the pypi JSON data.
