TODO
====

- Add i18n
- Add navpill-style and table-style list views for projects; make list style
  selectable in edit menu [Can/should this be punted to Kotti folder view?]
- Sort out and document metadata items available in setup.py vs. those
  requiring manual entry on pypi or in kotti_software. See what happens when
  bugtrack_url, home_page, and download_url are added to setup.py. What is
  download_url vs. package_url? Does url in setup.py map to home_page?
  [Home page, Download URL, and Bugtrack URL are editable on pypi. If they
  are not available in setup.py, then if set manually on pypi, are they
  overwritten by new release pushes to pypi, or do they stick?]
- Check on need for required testing dependencies copied from kotti_media
- Add support for using tags to categorize by group with an example,
  or add a "sub-collection" property if the tags route is not workable.
- Presently, the view for SoftwareCollection does a site-wide search for all
  SoftwareProject items. Should this be changed to context.children? [Ties in
  with tags and/or categorization question.]
- Change use of all-jambed-up softwarecollection to software-collection and
  software_collection; same for softwareproject. Or, OK as is?
- Add better visual separation between items in default list view (the only
  list view style available now; see above todo item)
- Are on-load refreshes from pypi and github too expensive? What are
  alternatives? Nightly cron job? More frequent cron job? Refreshing on a
  timer? Every 5 minutes? Every hour? Manual trigger by admin?
