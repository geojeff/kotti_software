TODO
====

- add i18n
- add a sort_order property, ASC or DESC
- add navpill-style list for projects; make list style selectable
- sort out and document metadata items available in setup.py vs. those
  requiring manual entry on pypi or in kotti_software. See what happens when
  bugtrack_url, home_page, and download_url are added to setup.py. What is
  download_url vs. package_url? Does url in setup.py map to home_page?
  [Home page, Download URL, and Bugtrack URL are editable on pypi. If they
  are not available in setup.py, then if set manually on pypi, are they
  overwritten by new release pushes to pypi?]
- check on need for required testing dependencies copied from kotti_media
