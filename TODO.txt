TODO
====

- add i18n
- add a sort_order property, ASC or DESC
- add navpill-style list for projects; make list style selectable
- sort out and document metadata items available in setup.py vs. those
  requiring manual entry on pypi or in kotti_software. See what happens when
  bugtrack_url, home_page, and download_url are added to setup.py. What is
  download_url vs. package_url? Does url in setup.py map to home_page?
